# Stripe Payment Integration Guide

## Overview

This e-commerce platform now includes full Stripe payment integration for secure payment processing.

## Setup Complete ✅

### 1. Environment Variables

The following environment variables have been configured in `.env.local`:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your Stripe publishable key (client-side)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key (server-side)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook endpoint secret (for webhook validation)

### 2. Stripe Configuration Files

- **`src/lib/stripe.ts`** - Client-side Stripe initialization
- **`src/lib/stripe-server.ts`** - Server-side Stripe instance

### 3. API Routes

- **`/api/checkout`** - Creates Stripe checkout sessions
- **`/api/webhooks/stripe`** - Handles Stripe webhook events

### 4. Payment Flow Pages

- **`/checkout/success`** - Payment success page
- **`/checkout/cancelled`** - Payment cancellation page

## How It Works

### 1. Checkout Process

1. User adds items to cart
2. Clicks "Checkout" in cart drawer or goes to `/checkout`
3. Fills out shipping information
4. Clicks "Place Order"
5. Redirected to Stripe Checkout
6. Completes payment on Stripe
7. Redirected back to success/cancelled page

### 2. Payment Processing

- All payment processing handled securely by Stripe
- No sensitive card data touches your servers
- Automatic 3D Secure authentication when required
- Support for various payment methods (cards, digital wallets)

## Test the Integration

### Test Cards (Use in Stripe Test Mode)

- **Successful Payment**: `4242424242424242`
- **Payment Requires Authentication**: `4000002500003155`
- **Payment Declined**: `4000000000000002`

Use any future expiry date and any 3-digit CVC.

### Test Flow

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Add some products to cart
3. Click checkout
4. Fill in shipping details
5. Click "Place Order"
6. Use test card: `4242424242424242`
7. Complete payment
8. Verify redirect to success page

## Webhook Setup (Optional for Development)

To test webhooks locally:

1. Install Stripe CLI: `stripe login`
2. Forward webhooks: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Copy webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local`

## Production Deployment

1. Replace test keys with live Stripe keys
2. Set up webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
3. Configure webhook secret
4. Test thoroughly with small amounts first
